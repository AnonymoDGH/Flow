Flow is an **educational prototype** that demonstrates multi-language orchestration by allowing you to write Python, JavaScript, and C++ code in a single file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Flow is a proof-of-concept for learning and experimentation. It is **NOT production-ready**. See [Production Readiness](#-production-readiness) section below.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Build Flow
make

# Run example (sequential mode - safe)
./flow examples/test.fl

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read this first
# See QUICK_REFERENCE.md for safe usage patterns
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Before using Flow, read**: [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - What to use and what to avoid

## üì¶ Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnonymoDGH/Flow.git
cd Flow
make
make install  # Optional: system-wide install
```

### Requirements

- g++ with C++17 support
- Python 3.x
- Node.js

## üéØ Why Flow?

Flow is an **educational project** that explores multi-language orchestration.

### The Concept
```bash
# Traditional approach: Multiple scripts
python extract.py
node transform.js
./analyze.exe
python cleanup.py
```

### Flow's Approach
```python
# One file, sequential execution
@data

# Python: Extract data
data = extract_from_db()
print("Data extracted")

# JavaScript: Transform
fn transform():
    console.log('Data transformed');

transform()

# C++: Analyze
cpp
std::cout << "Data analyzed" << std::endl;
end
```

```bash
flow pipeline.fl  # Simple execution
```

### Reality Check

**What Flow does well**:
- Demonstrates multi-language integration concept
- Simplifies sequential script execution
- Good for learning and prototyping

**What Flow doesn't do**:
- ‚ùå Reliable shared memory (race conditions)
- ‚ùå Safe parallel execution (data corruption)
- ‚ùå Production-grade error handling
- ‚ùå Security hardening for untrusted code

**For production use**, consider:
- **Airflow/Prefect**: Mature workflow orchestration
- **Docker Compose**: Container-based multi-language pipelines
- **Polyglot notebooks**: Jupyter with multiple kernels
- **gRPC/ZeroMQ**: Proper inter-process communication

## ‚ú® Features

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Multi-language execution**: Python, JavaScript, and C++ in one file
- **Sequential execution**: Reliable execution order
- **Basic IPC**: File-based communication between languages
- **Error handling**: Pipeline stops on first error
- **Multi-file support**: Organize code with `import "file.fl"`
- **Command injection protection**: Basic sanitization implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Features (Known Issues)
- **Shared memory** (`flow_set()`/`flowGet()`): Race conditions cause data loss/corruption
- **Parallel execution** (`@parallel`): Not thread-safe, causes unpredictable behavior
- **Package system**: Basic implementation, not tested at scale
- **CI/CD integration**: Works but limited error reporting

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- **Transaction support**: No rollback on failures
- **Proper IPC**: Uses JSON files instead of message queues
- **Security hardening**: Basic protections only
- **Production monitoring**: Metrics are basic

## üéì Examples

### Basic Example (‚úÖ Reliable)

```python
# hello.fl
@data

# Python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello from Python, {name}!")

greet("World")

# JavaScript
fn greet_js():
    console.log('Hello from JavaScript!');

greet_js()

# C++
cpp
std::cout << "Hello from C++!" << std::endl;
end
```

### Shared Memory Example (‚ö†Ô∏è Has Race Conditions)

```python
# memory_test.fl
@data

# Python
flow_set('counter', 0)
print(f"Python set: {flow_get('counter')}")

# JavaScript
fn test():
    let val = flowGet('counter');
    flowSet('counter', val + 1);
    console.log('JS incremented:', flowGet('counter'));

test()

# C++
cpp
int val = std::stoi(flowGet("counter", "0"));
flowSet("counter", std::to_string(val + 1));
std::cout << "C++ incremented: " << flowGet("counter", "0") << std::endl;
end

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Results may be inconsistent due to race conditions
# Expected: 0, 1, 2
# Actual: May show 0, 0, 1 or other incorrect values
```

### Parallel Execution (‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental)

```python
@parallel

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Parallel mode has known race conditions
# Use only for independent tasks that don't share data

# Python: Independent task
print("Python task")

# JavaScript: Independent task
fn task():
    console.log('JavaScript task');

task()

# C++: Independent task
cpp
std::cout << "C++ task" << std::endl;
end
```

## üß™ Testing & Known Issues

### Test Results

```bash
# Sequential execution: ‚úÖ PASS
./flow examples/test.fl
# Result: Executes in correct order

# Shared memory: ‚ùå FAIL (Race conditions)
./flow examples/memory_test.fl
# Expected: counter = 0, 1, 2
# Actual: counter = 0, 0, 1 (data loss)

# Parallel execution: ‚ùå FAIL (Data corruption)
./flow examples/parallel_test.fl
# Result: Unpredictable, data corruption

# Security: ‚úÖ PASS (Basic protection)
./flow examples/security_test.fl
# Result: Command injection blocked
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The shared memory system uses JSON files without proper locking:

```cpp
// Current implementation (UNSAFE)
void flowSet(key, value) {
    json data = read_json("__flow_shared__.json");  // Read
    data[key] = value;                               // Modify
    write_json("__flow_shared__.json", data);        // Write
}
// Problem: Another process can read/write between these steps
```

**Why it fails**:
1. Process A reads file: `{counter: 0}`
2. Process B reads file: `{counter: 0}` (same value!)
3. Process A writes: `{counter: 1}`
4. Process B writes: `{counter: 1}` (overwrites A's change!)
5. Result: Lost update, counter should be 2 but is 1

**What's needed**:
- File locking (flock/fcntl)
- Atomic operations
- Or better: Replace with proper IPC (ZeroMQ, Redis, etc.)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Can I use Flow in production?

**No, not recommended.** Flow is an educational prototype with known critical issues (race conditions, limited security, no transactions). For production, use mature tools like Airflow, Prefect, or Docker Compose.

### Why does shared memory fail?

Flow uses JSON files without proper locking. Multiple processes can read/write simultaneously, causing race conditions and data loss. This is a fundamental architectural limitation.

### Is parallel mode safe?

**No.** Parallel execution has race conditions that cause data corruption. Use sequential mode (`@data`) for reliable results.

### Will these issues be fixed?

Fixing them requires a complete rewrite:
- Replace file-based IPC with ZeroMQ/gRPC
- Add proper locking mechanisms
- Implement transaction support
- Add security sandboxing

This would take 10-18 months of full-time development.

### What should I use Flow for?

Flow is great for:
- Learning about multi-language orchestration
- Quick prototypes and experiments
- Educational demonstrations
- Personal research scripts

### What are the alternatives?

For production use:
- **Airflow/Prefect/Dagster**: Workflow orchestration
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container pipelines
- **Polyglot notebooks**: Jupyter with multiple kernels
- **Shell scripts + proper IPC**: ZeroMQ, Redis, RabbitMQ

### Can I contribute?

Yes! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Focus areas:
- Improving documentation
- Adding test cases
- Fixing bugs in sequential mode
- Creating educational examples
